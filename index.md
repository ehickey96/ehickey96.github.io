# ePortfolio - Elijah Hickey
### About
   This page will showcase a journey I took. The goal was to take older projects I had, and improve upon them to create polished professional projects as a capstone for the Computer Science program at SNHU.  This would double as an ePortfolio, showcasing my skills and strengths as a software engineer. I started with a enhancement plan which discussed the projects, how they could be improved, and what those improvements show. Then, I performed a code review for those original projects. Then work began on improving the various artifacts. Finally, I made a professional Self Reflection to highlight the journey, showcase my skills and what a learned, and highlight my strengths as a software engineer. The index can be used to jump to each section, and links to each project's github page or other various other links are found within this document. The refinement plan is kept & quoted as those are the original documents. The rest will be updated to fit in this ePortfolio.

# Professional Self Assessment

This professional self-assessment will serve as a reflection on my experience within my Computer Science program as SNHU and during the developement of this capstone, and showcase the projects I've included within this ePortfolio. This was done over an 8 week course, which also helps demosntrate my adaptibility and ability to learn. I have learned a tremendous amount at SNHU and I have grown during this capstone, and this will be exemplified by this ePortfolio.  

### Educational Program Experience
   My academic journey has been invaluable at shaping me as a well rounded and confident software engineer. I have learned many different skills throughout this program and was able to showcase and polish my skills during the creation process of this ePortfolio. 
An import skill I learned was working within a team environment. During the Software Development Lifecycles course, I learned how to act as the various roles within an Agile team, and the strengths of such a team. It grew my team collaboration experience while giving me specific knowledge of Agile. This course also gave me an understanding of communication with stakeholders, and how beneficial  strong open communication is. It enables projects to be understood fully be all parties, and helps manage expectations and clarify realities of the project. The Collaboration and Team Projects course also presented me with the opportunities to work in a team environment working with version control. The skills I gained using Git and working as a team member will be crucial when I work with teams. This course showed the importance of managing multiple versions of a project, something I still practice even when the project is independent of a team. 
<br/>

   The introduction to SQL, Fundamentals of Data Mining and Client Server Development course helped me gain a strong understanding of databases and practice, creating, managing, utilizing, and implementing databases into other systems. During this capstone, I would apply that knowledge and create a MySQL database and incorporate it to my third Artifact found within this ePortfolio. My data structures and algorithms course advanced my understanding and capabilities as a software engineer. I worked with various data structure types, began understanding the importance of time and space complexity, and began to incorporate more advanced algorithms such as creating a method to search through a binary tree to add or remove entries. This knowledge advanced my understanding and appreciation of algorithms and data structures, and the role they play.  
<br/> 
Other skills gained can be see in the many courses that helped grow my understanding of software design as well as security. The majority of my courses throughout my program expanded on my understanding of software design, and promoted security. Object Oriented Analysis and Design gave me a more advanced understanding of the design project and gave me in depth practice creating various design documentation (sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, class diagrams, CRC cards and more) as well as the value they add to the design process. This gave me practice with detailed design methods and strengthened me as a Software Engineer. Finally, throughout my program, I had been shown the importance of security throughout the development process. My Secure Programming course helped improve my understanding and skills in secure programming. I worked to create a security policy, understand defense in-depth, perform various testing, and gained experience practicing more advanced secure programming techniques and tests. These techniques have been carried over and can be seen throughout the projects here. There are many other incredibly courses I have taken at SNHU , which have also all aided in my growth as a software engineer.
<br/>

### Portfolio Experience & Summary

   The three main enhanced artifacts of this portfolio demonstrate my ability to expand upon existing system, my software design strengths, use of advanced algorithms, utilization of databases, and development with security in mind. Additionally, each artifact was enhanced in under a weeks time, which further showcases my strengths as a Software Developer. The first artifact takes an extremely basic C++ console application that allowed for basic client management, and looks to expand upon it will remaking it in another programming language. The language I felt most comfortable in was C++, so during these projects all the artifacts were developed with Java. This program was rebuilt in Java as closely as possible to the original artifact. Then, additional functionalities and security improvements were added.  
<br/>
	
   The second artifact was taken from an old Java console app that functioned as a menu system for a luxury cruise company. In the short time I worked on the app, I expanded upon the complexities of the system. The various class objects become much more detailed, and a dependency hierarchy was developed and adhered to. Prior to the enhancement, any dependances or connections was not enforced. For example, while a Cruise might state what ship it is using, there was no connection or validation of any sort. I looked to enforce as many dependences as possible throughout the app. Additionally, I used more advanced algorithms that could calculate what room costs should be to meet profit goals given specific criteria (and based off these calculations, the various pricing of the cruise could be adjusted to), as well as developed a simulator that can simulate potential customers to give profit predictions for a given cruise.   
<br/>

   The third artifact came from the first enhancement. At this point, the menu system required users to login, and from there they could display clients or change a clients investment choice. The enhancements I planned for this artifact was to create and incorporate a database within the app. I accomplished this and then looked towards expanding its functionality. For another update, I wished to add more functionality to the program, incorporated permission validation system for the users, as well as allow the program to be utilize a GUI menu instead of simply being a console app. I succeeded in this, all while promoting as much security throughout the process.  This project forced me to work with many new tools. I added a GUI & a Database connectivity to an existing program, all while maintaining existing functionality, and expanding upon its features and security. 
<br/>
I learned so much during this capstone, and it has been an extremely validating process. Managing many new concepts quickly has been a challenging and fun experience. This portfolio is a reflection on my experience as a student and during this capstone, and demonstrates my skills, flexiblity, and ability to learn. 



# Artifact Selection and Refinement Plan
<br/>

<details>
	<summary>I. Artifact One: Design</summary>
	
   The artifact for the first Category will be taken from my CS-410 Project One and Two. These projects required me to take an object file, explain its functionality, and using that make a similar cpp file. Then for project two I had to identify coding vulnerabilities and fix them. For the enhancements, 
The enhancement plan will start by recreating the original C++ program into a Java program. Once the program is remade, the next steps will be to add enhancements. An example of specific enhancements include adding a function that records each successful login (the username, password, and what time it takes place.) Another enhancement would also require usernames to be valid, and correspond to their given password. See flowchart on following page.
The main skill being illustrated here is my ability to recreate a program into another language, while retaining the original programs look and functionality. This aligns with the category one modification to transfer a project into a different language. Login accounting and proper username / password pair verification aligns with the enhancements of improving and expanding a projects complexity. 
	
</details>
	
<details>
	<summary>II. Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</summary>
<br/>
	
This artifact came from my IT-145 Project. The original project was a simple console application that allowed users to see the ships, cruises, and passengers, and add or edit them.	
<br/>
	
   The enhancement plan follows the flowchart seen on the next page, yellow highlights the additional complexities. It looks to add more complicated algorithms and data structures to the program. It does this be adding many different attributes to each object type. Some of the attributes would be automatically calculated (such as Net Profit for a cruise.) The main modification would be expanding complexity of algorithms. For this, a recommended price calculator/simulator will recommend what can be done to match the goal profit based off expected passengers, expected room allocations ratios, and the maximum expected amount each tier of passenger is willing to spend on a room type and the variance expected within that maximum. It will work by distributing the expected passengers within the rooms based off the given ratios, and determine what price’s can be set for each room type to meet the profit goals (a passenger is removed if their preferred room type is out of their maximum spending amount.) 
<br/>
	
   This calculator is the main modification being made and adds a complex algorithm to calculate and simulate passenger distribution. This is used to help gauge what the price of each room should be set to, that way desired profit margins can better be met. This modification aligns with the expanded complexity of algorithms modification. 
<br/>
</details>
	
<details>
  <summary>III. Artifact Three: Database (Scrapped)</summary>
	
<br/>	
	
>This artifact does not currently exist, as the only three projects I have worked on that work with databases are locked behind my older courses. So this new project will be creating a full stack web application program that connects to a MongoDB with a python middleware. The enhancement plan is to create a full stack web application from scratch. It will start by creating a CSV file with the given data and then importing it to MongoDB. Then a Python Module will be used to perform operations on the database (CRUD operations minimum.) Finally a basic web application will be used to display results from the database, with the python module being used as middleware. The current plan is also to use Jupyter to create the front end of the stack. This demonstrates being able to make a full stack application, which is a variance of one of the recommended modifications for category three. 
	
<br/>
</details>
	
<details>
	<summary>III. Artifact Three: (Updated)</summary>
<br/>
	
At this point, the new enhancement plan (I discuss this in my code review) was to create a database, incorporate that with the first enhanced artifact, and incorporate the add & remove client functionality. I ended up adding more than this, as you can see in the updated narrative [here](#artifact-three--databases--updated)

<br/>	
</details>



# Code Review

   The code review is a walkthrough of my two artifacts. At this point, I had already swapped my plans for the old artifact three to the new one. I discuss security risks of my code, and highlight various strengths and weaknesses. For instance, I discuss the various validations I had for user input within the original first Artifact (Code below.) These are simple validations but are import to prevent undefined behavior or other common security risks. 
   
<br/>

```c++
    cout << "Enter your password: " << endl;
    cin >> password;
    //SECURITY FIX: ensures entry is a int
    while (!cin) {
        cout << "Password is numeric only, try again." << endl;
        cin.clear();
        cin.ignore();
        cin >> password;
    }
```
   I showed where the projects met their requirements, but also highlighted how they failed to meet best standards, or could be inproved. These areas for improve would later be focused on during my enhancements of the project. Examples of issues included excessive commenting (which partially was done at the time to meet course requirements.)

### Artifact One | Design | Narrative
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br/>  
	
*Artifact Description*	
	
   The artifact is a C++ program file. It was originally a product of my CS-410 Reverse Engineering final projects, which were finished in August 2021. The project was to take an object file without any documentation and recreate it as a C++ program after interpreting the assembly code, then applying some security fixes to it. 
	
 	
*Justification*	
	
   This artifact was chosen as I felt it was basic but easily could be improved or modified in many ways. Additionally, the choice to use this artifact was based on it also being a prime candidate to add a database to, without being overly complicated. This artifact also shows my reverse engineering ability, and felt that being able to recreate this into another language (Java) also demonstrated an important and related skillset. The artifact has been improve as it now properly validates a proper username/password combination, and will record login history or attempts to a text file (or create the text file if there is none.) 
	
 	
*Reflection*
	
   During my enhancement, I immediately realized how rusty I was at Java compared to C++. This turned out to be a positive for me, as it gave me more experience with Java, and showed my ability to work with languages I am less comfortable with. I imagine the main challenges for this assignment will be to come during Enhancement Three and the inclusion of a database. This project was developed at the very start with security in mind, as various validation was done for all user input and other security checks such as ensuring an index position exists before trying to access an array. This artifact demonstrates my skills with design and engineering.

### Artifact Two | Algorithms | Narrative
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br/>	
	
*Artifact Description*
	
   The artifact is a Java program that was originally a project of my IT-145 Course. For this project, we were given a partially made menu-based program to manage cruises, ships, and passengers for a cruise company. This had specific requirements that we had to follow, but most of the project was just setting up basic object classes, and menu system handling.	
	
	
*Justification*	
	
   I chose this artifact, as I felt it was more complicated than the previous and could simply be modified to become a much more advanced system. I felt it was a clean base program that could be brought in multiple different directions. An additional benefit is that I will also be gaining even more Java experience which was something I was hoping for at the start of this course. This artifact was very elementary, but after successfully applying my enhancements well clearly show my ability to handle expanding to a more complex system, and my ability to incorporate more complicated algorithms. 
	
		
*Reflection*
	
   During this enhancement, I made a big mistake by adding too many attributes and adding a system that connects these various classes. This ended up creating a snowball effect of creating a complicated program that was hard to track and was taking a lot of work to maintain (mostly due to the short time frame I could work on this.) This program showcases my ability to work with more complex systems as there was multiple dependences (documented in the readme and found throughout the code.) It also demonstrated the use of more advanced algorithms, such as a simulator or calculator sections of the program. 
<br/>	

Here is an example from the simulation part of the program. You pass the expected amount of customers, customer interest distribution, max amount each customer type is willing to spend, and maximum amount of variance. Then it will simulate every customer and how many would be interested in their room given the price.

### Artifact Three | Databases | Narrative
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>	
<br/>

*Artifact Description*
	
   The original artifact comes from the first enhancement included within the ePortfolio. A description of the ORIGINAL (the one that the first enhancement modified is as follows: 
>The artifact is a Java program that was originally a project of my IT-145 Course. For this project, we were given a partially made menu-based program to manage cruises, ships, and passengers for a cruise company. This had specific requirements that we had to follow, but most of the project was just setting up basic object classes, and menu system handling.
	
The previous artifact was a recreated Java version of that program (it was originally C++). It included a proper username/password validation and a login recorder.
	

*Justification*	
	
   This artifact was chosen because it seemed the most straight forward to add a database too. Since I had to add a database to a program which was not designed around a database, I thought a simpler program would be the most reasonable for a database within this time window. This worked well, as I could add the database, and then add more complexities, rather than the other way around. This will help meet requirements by demonstrating the incorporation of a DB within a project, search functionality and some CRUD functionality within (currently I plan to add a delete and add client methods, due to time restraints wont be included for this submission.)
	
	
*Reflection*	
	
   During this enhancement I was nervous about the inclusion of a database into an existing program, as that was new for me. I also had never created my own database from scratch before. I set up MySQL on my computer, and after I while I figured out how to properly create the database and users for it. I filled the database, then began working towards incorporating the database within the artifact. The artifact works by asking if the user wants to connect to the database. If the user says no, or if they say yes but the connection cannot be completed, the program will run the entire time utilizing only the mock hardcoded data. If a db connection is made, it will utilize the db. This was a great learning experience as there was a lot of new concepts for me here. 
<br/>	

Here is a snippet of a function that from grabbed all the clients from the database.  It showcases my repeated security checks and best practises. 
<br/>
```c++
    //function to get all the clients (will then call the client interpreter)
    public static ArrayList getAllClients() {
    	//first, double checks that there is still is a connection
    	try {
			Connection connection = getConnection();
			try {
				Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
				ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM clients");
				
				ArrayList<Client> serverClients = new ArrayList();
				
				//loops through the result set, getting each client and adding it to serverClient array
				while(results.next()) {
					Client client = resultsinterpreterClient(results);
					serverClients.add(client);
				}
				
				return serverClients;	
				
			//sql error
			} catch (SQLException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}	
			
			//returns null indicating query failed
	    	return null;	
	    	//connection lost after program has been started & connection was originally validated
		} catch (SQLException e) {
			throw new RuntimeException("Error: Connection lost after intitional connection test. Now Closeing.", e);
		}	
    }
```

   This artifact received a large updated after the original submission. A GUI was added, and the program can either be run as a basic console app or as with a GUI. The method to determine how the app will launch is within the driver.java file. The GUI features the same validations on input (and will prompt the user with red text if input is invalid.) This app additionally now has proper add and remove client functionality, and as well has been packaged into an executable jar file (this jar was tested on a seperate machine to confirm functionality.) This project GUI & functionality expansion was done in just two days with libraries & features that I was unfamilier with. Incorporating a database into an existing program, as well as a GUI, were both topics I was unfamiliar with. This project showcases my ability to learn new skills quickly and effectively, as well as my knowledge and use of databases. 
<br/> 
	
The github page for this project will have a README discussing how to use the program and more detailed features, the project itself, and the executable jar file.
